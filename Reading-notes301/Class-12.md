## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL|NoSQL
---|---
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); | whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases are table based databases | whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
SQL databases have predefined schema | whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable | whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

 	 
 	 
 	 
## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records)
## Give a real world example.
ecommerce
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
data from molecular modeling, Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured. Likewise, data from social media analysis and websites is also highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined. In such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice. 
## Give a real world example.
