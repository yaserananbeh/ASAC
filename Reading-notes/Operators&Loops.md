# Operator & Loops

## Here I will put my notes about the Operator & Loops topic from Read 05

# Operators

### comparision operator
we using it to compare two values and the result of those operators is True or False 
some example of those operator 

`==` Is equal to This to sure if the two sides before and after is equal each other then will return true if not equal will return false 

`!=` Is not equal this to be sure if the two sides is not equal eathother, return true if is not and return false if equal each other 

`===` to be sure if the two sides of arround the operator is equal each other in value and datatype

`!==` to be sure if the two sides are not equal in the value and in the data type as well.

`> ` Greater than 

`<` less than 

`<=` less than or equal to 

`>=` greater than or equal to 

## Example of the Comparision operator ( VAR >= Var)
should contain two operand around to operator and  closing brackets of the whole statment 

### logical operator 
This operator allow us to compare the result of two or more one comparison operator

here the logical operators

`&&` And logical operator this operator return true only if the result of two operend equal true

`||` Or logical operator this return false only if the result of the two sides is equal False

`!` Not operator to return the opposite of the result (if true will return false and if false will return true)


# Loops 

## What is the loops 

It's a block of code that has a ititalize value and condition and counter and has a two brackets that contains the excution code which will be run everytime will return the condition true 

## Types of loops like 
`for` and `while ` and `do while `

## Example of the For loop 
```
for(var i=0; i<10;i++){
    document.write("Yaser");
}
```

## Example of the While loop

```
var i = l ;
var sum = 0 ;

while (i < 10) {
sum = sum + i ;
i++;
document.write(sum); 

```

### The main difference between for and while 
 - in for we use it usually with the numbers and we should know the End of the loop
 - in while it is more efficient with the strings and we use with the cases that we don't how many the code will run
