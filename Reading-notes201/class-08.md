# CSS Layout

### there's two types of element regarding to the type of blocks
- block elements like (div , p, ul , ol , h1-h6, li)
- inline elements like (i , span , img , b , strong )

### positioning the elements 
- position : static (the default )
- position : fixed (the element will freez in the same position without moveing like the nav bar )
- position : relative (like the static but we can control the top,right,left,bottom to control the position)
- position : absolute (like the fixed but we can control the top..bottom to change the position inside container which it position is relative )

### we can control the z-index to control how will the element overlap the other elements 
### also we can control the floating to change the position of the elemet to be on left or right

## Summary 
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
