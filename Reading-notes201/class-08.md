### Events 

There's a three ways to bind an event to an element 
- html Element Handler (bad practice to use it )
- Dom event handler `element .onevent functionName ;`
- Event listeners `element .addEventlistener('event', functionName [, Boolean]) ;`
- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). 
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
