# Android Fundamentals


kotlin java and c++ are used to write android programs.

android is multi user linux os system, it means each app treated as different user.

each app created has it's own unique id.

least privilege means when each application can access only it's own components and no further.

two apps can share the same user id, and run on same virtual machine.

if user want privilege to access devices such as camera, location etc.. it should request to do so.

App components
components are building block of android application.

there are four types of components.

Activities

Services

Broadcast receivers

Content providers

Activities
activities are interface with entry point that interact with user.

activity can be like read list od data., it can also be doing some other task like for example creating data.

together they form the application.

to do app example :

activity to show todo.

activity to add todo.

activity to remove todo.

together they make todo application.

Services
entry point for keeping an app running in the background.

service does not provide a user interface, which means it might run something in the background while user doing something else.

service might fetch data over the network

Broadcast receivers
component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow.

broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app.

Content providers
it manage a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system.
Activating components
activities, services, and broadcast receivers are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent.

Intents bind components to each other at runtime.

Intent object create a message to activate a component or a specific type of component.

activity and service define the action to do.

content providers are not activated by intents.

they are activated when targeted by a request from a ContentResolver.

The manifest file
android system know if component file exit from manifest file when system read it.

app must declare all its components in this file.

things manifest does in addition to declaring the app's components:

Identifies user permissions the app require.

Declares the minimum API Level required by the app.

Declares hardware and software features used or required by the app such as camera.

Declares API libraries the app needs to be linked against.
