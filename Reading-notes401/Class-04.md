## Objects and classes 
Objects : similar to real-world objects and in programming are the containers that have a properties and behavior and it can be anything we can work with 
**benefits of using them :**
enhance the modularity , readability and debugging the code 

Classes : as a blueprints or templates to make a objects 
Some important information: 
- A class declaration names the class and encloses the class body between braces. The class name can be preceded by modifiers. The class body contains fields, methods, and constructors for the class. A class uses fields to contain state information and uses methods to implement behavior. Constructors that initialize a new instance of a class use the name of the class and look like methods without a return type.
- to create an object from a class by using the new operator and a constructor. The new operator returns a reference to the object that was created. You can assign the reference to a variable or use it directly.
- Instance variables and methods that are accessible to code outside of the class that they are declared in can be referred to by using a qualified name. The qualified name of an instance variable looks like this:

objectReference.variableName
The qualified name of a method looks like this:

objectReference.methodName(argumentList)
or:

objectReference.methodName()

- The garbage collector automatically cleans up unused objects. An object is unused if the program holds no more references to it. You can explicitly drop a reference by setting the variable holding the reference to null.

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
- Binary : with the binary we have to digits (0,1) and the base (2)
- Decimal : The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
- Hexadecimal : They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15

Decimal:	
        
        0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15

Hexadecimal:	

        0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F
