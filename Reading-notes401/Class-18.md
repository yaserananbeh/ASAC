Many to many relationships
This tutorial shows how the @ManyToMany annotation can be used for specifying this type of relationships in Hibernate.

Database Setup:

created database with the name spring_hibernate_many_to_many

create the employee and project tables along with the employee_project join table with employee_id and project_id as foreign keys

Once that is setup, preparation of the Maven dependencies and Hibernate configuration needs to be done.

Create model classes with JPA annotations. When both classes refer to one another, the association between them is bidirectional.

In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations.

@ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities. This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side.

@JoinTable is used to define the join/link table.

@JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table.

Security: a humorous overview
It's almost as though security researchers have issues with public relations since they make it impossible to do everything you want on a website. Security experts are always working to address security vulnerabilities and improve people's ability to establish more secure passwords. Any password may be hacked. Using the same password for everything isn't a smart idea. Security researchers utilize the threat model to prevent security breaches by instructing individuals on how to create passwords and where security risks originate, although security breaches don't always come from apparent sources. There is no such thing as a flawless security system, and any security system, no matter how robust, will be breached at some point. To make things more safe, information flow control and security labels are employed. The majority of individuals do not want to pay a lot of money merely to make their system safer. As a result, security researchers should focus on what will happen when I properly construct my software, rather than what may happen.
