## Here I will put my notes about the Command Line topic from Read01

### Command line
    A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

    The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
### some command that we will use on the termenal
#### pwd
    to know where we are on any file now

#### ls
    to know the content of the file that we already in

#### cd 
    we use it move around the system files 

### The files
    everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc.
#### here some example about files Extentions
    file.exe - an executable file, or program.
    file.txt - a plain text file.
    file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
##### Note : Each file has a Extention that we use to make the computer know what the type of file
