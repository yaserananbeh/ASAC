## Here I will put my notes about the text editor topic from Read01

#### What is a text editor
        A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
        your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
        allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
        to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
        important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
#### What features should you look for in a text editor?
        the most important features are: 
        1 - code completion; 
        2 - syntax highlighting;
        3 - a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue);
        4 - the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

#### Third-Party Options
        Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
        Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
        and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
        of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
        about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
        widely used in web development today.
